# hipparcos_space_exploration
A portfolio project that uses open access data from the ESA Hipparcos mission consisting of a dataset of astrometric data. I use this data to plot stellar maps and to build a machine-learning model to approximate the spectral type of each object and approximate their Temperature, Luminosity, Radius, and Mass.
